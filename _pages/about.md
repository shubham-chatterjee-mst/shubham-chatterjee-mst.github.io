<p>
I'm <strong>Shubham Chatterjee</strong>, an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at <strong>Missouri University of Science and Technology (Missouri S&T)</strong>. My research is driven by the mission to redefine how we access and understand information in the digital age. I focus on pushing the boundaries of <strong>Information Retrieval (IR)</strong> and <strong>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)</strong> using <strong>Large Language Models (LLMs)</strong>, striving to create smarter, more intuitive systems that bridge the gap between complex data and human understanding.
</p>

<p>
Before joining Missouri S&T, I worked as a <strong>Research Associate</strong> at the 
<a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/" target="_blank"><strong>University of Edinburgh, UK</strong></a>. 
There, I was part of the 
<a href="https://grilllab.ai/" target="_blank"><strong>Alexa-award-winning GRILL Lab</strong></a>, 
led by <strong>Turing AI Fellow Dr. Jeff Dalton</strong>, and focused on advancing conversational AI and neural information retrieval (IR). 
Initially, the GRILL Lab was based at the 
<a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/" target="_blank"><strong>University of Glasgow</strong></a>, 
where we were part of the 
<a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/research/researchsections/ida-section/informationretrieval/" target="_blank">
<strong>world-leading Glasgow IR Group</strong></a>. 
Later, the lab moved to Edinburgh and became part of the prestigious 
<a href="https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/ilcc" target="_blank">
<strong>Institute for Language, Cognition, and Computation (ILCC)</strong></a>. 
These transitions offered me a rich collaborative environment at the forefront of IR and AI research.
</p>

<p>
Prior to that, I was part of the <strong>Text Retrieval, Extraction, Machine Learning, and Analytics (TREMA) Lab</strong> at the 
<strong>University of New Hampshire, USA</strong>, where I earned my 
<strong>PhD in Computer Science</strong> under the mentorship of 
<a href="https://www.cs.unh.edu/~dietz/" target="_blank"><strong>Dr. Laura Dietz</strong></a>.
</p>

<p>
As a researcher and educator, my work focuses on developing systems that move beyond simple information retrieval to understanding, reasoning, and interacting with knowledge. My ultimate goal is to advance the field of AI by building adaptive systems that make information access more personalized, conversational, and impactful across diverse applications.
