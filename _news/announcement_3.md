# PhD Position in Applications of Large Language Models to Neural Information Retrieval

- **Position Title:** PhD Researcher in Neural Information Retrieval
- **Number of Positions:** 2
- **Institution:** Missouri S&T
- **Location:** Rolla, MO, USA
- **Start Date:** Fall 2025
- **Duration:** 3-4 years

## **About the Position**  
We are seeking a motivated and talented PhD student to join our research team in the transformative fields of **Neural Information Retrieval** with a focus on **Web Search** and **Conversational Search**. This position focuses on exploring how **Large Language Models (LLMs)** can redefine intelligent information access systems, such as search engines, recommendation platforms, and conversational assistants.

A central focus of this research is the integration of **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** frameworks, where LLMs are augmented with retrieval capabilities to enhance their ability to generate accurate, contextually grounded, and relevant responses. You will work on developing adaptive systems that combine the generative strengths of LLMs with robust retrieval pipelines, enabling applications such as multi-turn conversational search, personalized recommendations, and entity-oriented information access.

Additionally, this position provides an opportunity to explore the potential of **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** in IR, designing systems that optimize retrieval strategies and user interaction. By leveraging RL techniques alongside LLMs and RAG architectures, the research aims to develop adaptive, feedback-driven frameworks capable of iterative query refinement, snippet-based relevance modeling, and dynamic reasoning.

This role offers access to state-of-the-art resources, opportunities for collaboration with leading researchers in IR and NLP, and the chance to contribute to impactful projects shaping the future of intelligent, context-aware, and adaptive information systems.

## **Key Responsibilities**  
- Conduct original research in the areas of Neural IR (webs search and conversational search), RAG, and LLMs. 
- Develop, evaluate, and implement novel algorithms and models for improving IR systems, with a focus on neural and hybrid approaches.
- Explore the use of LLMs for tasks such as query generation, document ranking, and conversational search. 
- Publish findings in top-tier conferences and journals (e.g., SIGIR, ACL, NeurIPS, etc.). 
- Collaborate with other researchers and faculty within the lab and external academic/industry partners. 
- Participate in mentoring undergraduate or master's students, as appropriate. 

## **Qualifications**  

### **Required**
- A masterâ€™s degree (or equivalent) in Computer Science, Data Science, or a related field. Exceptional bachelorâ€™s degree holders may also be considered. 
- Demonstrated expertise in **Information Retrieval (IR)**, **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, and **Large Language Models (LLMs)** (including fine-tuning, training, and applications), as well as a strong foundation in **machine learning** and **deep learning**, evidenced by research publications, undergraduate or masterâ€™s theses, academic projects, or significant open-source contributions.
- Proficiency in programming languages such as Python and familiarity with machine learning frameworks (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow). 
- Strong analytical and problem-solving skills. 
- Excellent communication skills and a passion for research. 

## **Preferred**  
- Knowledge of reinforcement learning.
- Strong background in mathematics and statistics.
- Familiarity with frameworks and datasets used in IR research (e.g., TREC, BEIR, MS MARCO). 
- Prior publications in relevant fields (SIGIR, ACL, EMNLP, NIPS, etc.)

## **What We Offer**  
- A collaborative and innovative research environment with access to state-of-the-art computational resources. 
- Full funding, including a competitive stipend, tuition coverage, and travel support for conferences. 
- Mentorship and support for career development, including opportunities to collaborate with top researchers in academia and industry. 
- The chance to work on impactful projects shaping the future of AI-powered information systems. 


## **How to Apply**  
Interested candidates should submit the following: 
- A CV or resume highlighting academic and research achievements. 
- A cover letter detailing your research interests, relevant experience, and motivation for pursuing this position. 
- Optional: Any relevant publications, project portfolios, or code repositories.

**Application Deadline:** Open until filled.

Please send your application materials or direct inquiries to [Your Name] at [Your Email Address].
